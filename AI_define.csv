1,"Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.",https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html
2,"Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.",https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence
3,"Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI). While narrow AI may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.",https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/?cn-reloaded=1
4,"Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to be the most disruptive class of technologies in driving digital business forward during the next ten years. Yet even among the most tech-savvy professionals, there is conflict over what it can and cannot do. The most promising aspect of applying AI in the legal profession lies in automating simple and repetitive tasks, like e-discovery or legal bill review, while enabling human experts to improve results beyond what machines or people could do alone. This combination allows for improved productivity, while driving significant time and resource savings.",https://www.behblaw.com/Hidden-Pages/The-Role-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Legal-Operations.pdf
5,"The world of technology is changing rapidly, with computers and now robots, replacing simple human activities. AI, simply put, is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent behavior. It is an umbrella term that refers to information systems inspired by biological systems, and encompasses multiple technologies including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing (“NLP”), machine reasoning, and strong AI.","The Future is here: Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Nishith Desai Associates, http://www.nishithdesai.com/"
