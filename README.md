## Text summarization
Text Summarization of extracts Artificial Intelligence (AI) definitions from from AI related articles using the TextRank Algorithm with Python (Jupyter)

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to prepare a model for automatic text summarization. Several paragraphs defining AI have been compiled from AI related articles online. Text summarization is an emerging use case of NLP, used to generate concise and meaningful summary of text from resources such as books, articles, research papers and tweets. 

This project has been prepared from the tutorial on Analytics Vidhya titled: "An Introduction to Text Summarization using the TextRank Algorithm (with Python implementation)"

## Files
We will be working on Python 3, Jupyter Notebook. This repository contains three files for reference and use: 
  1) README.md --> the current file you are reading
  2) AI_define.ipynb --> Python file that trains the model for text summarization
  3) AI_define.csv --> (utf-8 encoded) csv. file that contains the four abstracts used to summarize
