## Text summarization
Text Summarization of AI and law related research paper abstracts using the TextRank Algorithm with Python (Jupyter)

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to prepare a model for automatic text summarization. Abstracts from four research papers (available on Researchgate) relating to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Law have been used to derive a short summary of the texts. Automatic text summarization is an emerging use case of NLP, used to generate concise and meaningful summary of text from resources such as books, articles, research papers and tweets. 

This project has been prepared from the tutorial on Analytics Vidhya titled: "An Introduction to Text Summarization using the TextRank Algorithm (with Python implementation)"

## Files
We will be working on Python 3, Jupyter Notebook. This repository contains three files for reference and use: 
  1) README.md --> the current file you are reading
  2) AILaw.ipynb --> Python file that trains the model for text summarization
  3) AILaw.csv --> (utf-8 encoded) csv. file that contains the four abstracts used to summarize
