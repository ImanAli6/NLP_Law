1,"The industry standard is increasing day by day due to the use of new technology. It also increased the standard of living. However, the employment pattern is shifting, and office jobs are becoming easier and more comfortable. The revolution due to AI technology and big data is bringing qualitative result with higher productivity rate which helps the industry and business to take more corrective decision and strategy, further expansion to wealth and value of the organization.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332411189_Artificial_Intelligence
2,"“Artificial” intelligence is not just a discourse about robots. It is about understanding the nature of cognition using computers as experimental devices. Therefore, it deals with the nature of inferential mechanisms, and the particular way computer programs allow us to produce inferences. Computer scientists are exploring this subject and there are many algorithms and programs for knowledge expansion through iterative and recursive revision. Artificial intelligence offers us methods and techniques to explain archaeological data. Although statistical reasoning is still giving its support to all these methods, it is not classical statistical inference. Artificial intelligence paradigms differ from usual classification and clustering methods",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329201999_Artificial_Intelligence
3,"There is much interest in moving AI out into real world applications, a move which has been encouraged by recent funding which has attempted to show industry and commerce can benefit from the Fifth Generation of computing. In this article I suggest that the legal application area is one which is very much more complex than it might- at first sight- seem. I use arguments from the sociology of law to indicate that the viewing of the legal system as simply a rule-bound discipline is inherently nave. This, while not new in jurisprudence, is- as the literature of AI and law indicates - certainly novel to the field of artificial intelligence. The socio-legal argument provided is set within the context of AI as one more example of the failure of scientific success and method to easily transmit itself over into the social sciences.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330841617
4,"Over the years, artificial intelligence (AI) is spreading its roots in different areas by utilizing the concept of making the computers learn and handle complex tasks that previously require substantial laborious tasks by human beings. With better accuracy and speed, AI is helping lawyers to streamline work processing. New legal AI software tools like Catalyst, Ross intelligence, and Matlab along with natural language processing provide effective quarrel resolution, better legal clearness, and superior admittance to justice and fresh challenges to conventional law firms providing legal services using leveraged cohort correlate model. This paper discusses current applications of legal AI and suggests deep learning and machine learning techniques that can be applied in future to simplify the cumbersome legal tasks.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326202085_Scope_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Law
